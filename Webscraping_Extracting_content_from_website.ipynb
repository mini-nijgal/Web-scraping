many times - has a curious way of laughing at us. After hours of planning, hours of training and hard work, and repetition, we may fall short of the desired outcome or an unforeseen event could lead us to an unknown path. That is when we usually take solace in the word 'fate' and say, \"It was not meant to be. Everything happens for a reason\". </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe's middle-order batsman, <a href=/profiles/9354/sikandar-raza>Sikandar Raza</a>, also could have blamed fate and asked himself, \"why me\" or \"what if\" after his grand plan to become a fighter Pilot in the PAF (Pakistan Air Force) was cut off abruptly. Raza was a faithful student to his dreams, tirelessly chasing them down in his own workshops. For a while, Raza's faith in his hard work seemed to have reaped rewards, as he passed the exam to enter the Pakistan Air Force School in Lower Topa. Incidentally, he was one of just 60 students who made the cut from thousands of aspirants. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Unfortunately, after training meticulously for three and a half years at the college, the final medical report indicated that there was 'lens opacity' - a blind spot in his eye. The blind spot affects a person when he is at an altitude. For a while, the chariot of his dreams was broken. Years of dedication and hardship for no reward it seemed. </p> </section>  <div class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\"> <div id=\"native_mid_article\" class=\"ad-native cb-ad-unit cb-nws-para\"></div> </div> <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> However, he did not lose hope. In 2002, Raza's parents (from Sialkot in Pakistan) moved to Zimbabwe. He pursued B.Sc in computer science at the Glasgow Caledonian University, Scotland, and that is when he started to play semi-professional cricket. He returned to Zimbabwe where he performed well in domestic cricket and has never looked back since. In a way, Raza is akin to a confident sea explorer who found the route to the shore when his crew members had lost hope. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Something people might not know, not a lot of people know is going to Air Force College was my decision,\" Raza said to Cricbuzz. \"I was fascinated by that, by the fighter planes and wanted to be a fighter pilot. Nobody grooved that in my mind. It was just my idea, at a very young age I wanted to be a fighter pilot. My family supported me through and through. That is something many people do not know. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Look, I always wanted to study. I always wanted to graduate with a degree. My family wanted the same as well. So while studying, I was also playing cricket. The switching wasn't too bad. It wasn't too difficult because cricket is something I really enjoyed, I loved the game. And I was playing in Scotland as a semi-professional. I spoke to my family, I spoke to my dad that I would like to take a year out of my studies and try my hand in cricket. I had good results in that year. So I went back and finished my degree and came back and started (cricket). Not started...I was trying to get picked by one of the franchises. I was luckily in a position at the right time, and I got picked and after that it has been a very blessed ride,\" he observed. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Now, Raza is undoubtedly one of the premier batsmen in the Zimbabwe set-up. He has notched up more than 2,000 ODI runs at 34.14 in the 50-over version, and has a creditable average of 38.1 in the traditional format. More importantly, he seems to be a capable finisher of the task in hand. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Some athletes are haunted by pressure and a few others lift themselves. Raza comes across as one of those cricketers who isn't simply satisfied by taking his side to the cusp of victory, he wants to take the team all the way. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza plays with a free mind, staying in the present. The point can be capsulised by his gritty, unbeaten 27 against Sri Lanka in Hambantota last year. The visitors, who were well-placed at 137 for 1, suddenly slid to 175 for 7, while chasing 204. But, Raza hung in there and when six runs were required, lofted Wanidu Hasaranga into the stands. Runs came in trickles but Raza didn't give it away, and instead chiselled Zimbabwe's first-ever series win in Sri Lanka. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Over his brief international career, Raza has made strong statements when it counted. He posted his first ODI hundred when the African country was hunting down a total of over 250 against Afghanistan in 2014. The very next year, when Zimbabwe were hurtling towards an embarrassing loss versus New Zealand (the tourists were 146 for 8 batting first), Raza stitched a stand of 89 for the ninth wicket with Tinashe Panyangara and piloted his side to a respectable 235 for 9. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> When Zimbabwe embarked on a trip to his land of birth, Pakistan, in 2015, he shone brightly with a superlative century in the Lahore ODI. His only Test hundred, which he composed in Sri Lanka last year, didn't just help Zimbabwe recover from a precarious 59 for 5 in the second essay, but also post a sizeable 388. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza noted that he tries to envisage different scenarios at nets to get himself mentally prepared and on occasions, waits for his 'gut feel' to guide him and say what is right. \"I think the best answer I can give you is to try and picture yourself before the game that this could happen to you. When you train, try and train in an atmosphere where you picture a lot of scenarios and you train for those scenarios. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"So when the scenario actually happens, you know you're mentally prepared. Our body is going through a lot of pain and a lot of training anyway, so physically you're always there. It is the mental side sometimes that gives in or doesn't accept an idea. In the nets, I'm not shy to try new things, try different methods, try and come up with my plans. And sometimes during a game, I go with an opposite plan - just what my gut feeling says to me. So, I just try and remain calm. I am a huge believer of just (giving) your best and what will be, will be,\" he added. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza's infectious energy on the field is also an indicator that he can become a fine leader. He has already showcased his leadership credentials by captaining his adopted country to a thrilling 10-run win over India in a T20I played in Harare in 2015. Just a day before the match, Prosper Utseya, the veteran cricketer, had levelled racism allegations against the then Zimbabwe Cricket Chairman Alistair Campbell. The African country had also slipped to 13 straight defeats in international cricket. So when Raza took over the leadership duties from an injured Elton Chigumbura, he had an uphill task but he passed the test with flying colours. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Captaining the side was a very blessed experience and what I remember was I was told 30 minutes before the toss I will be captaining because Elton [Chigumbura] was not fit. We waited for his result of his fitness test, and only 30 minutes before I was told that I was captaining today's game, so it was all very quick like it was a T20 game. So the game is pretty quick as well. So it was a very good and blessed experience,\" Raza said. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe will certainly bank on the in-form Raza to make an impact in the upcoming World Cup Qualifiers at home. With ICC deciding to shorten the number of teams in the 50-over World Cup to just 10 and eight countries having already qualified, 10 teams will battle it out in the Qualifiers for the remaining two spots. So there is a lot at stake for Zimbabwe's players. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> The World Cup Qualifies is also held at a time when Zimbabwe Cricket is still facing cash flow problems. Incidentally, ZC presently is in debt to numerous institutions - amounting to $19m. Cricketers have had to wade through delays in relation to match allowances. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe have also been paddling through troubled times since the start of this millennium. The African country has been hit by high unemployment rate, poverty and inflation. On November 15 last year, the army took control of Zimbabwe, with Robert Mugabe, the long-standing president, being ousted. Raza said that in the prevailing circumstances, a fine performance by the Zimbabwe cricket team on their home soil could bring some much needed cheer to a country wading through a tough phase. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"The honesty of the matter is this is one of the most important tournaments of our careers, a lot is hindering on it. In a way, it will define which way Zimbabwe cricket, in which way our careers go as well. 15 million people are hoping for a good result, and a time like this, in Zimbabwe all of us could use a little bit of happiness and a of bit good news as well. So there is a lot in this qualifiers for us. Hopefully, the more lives we touch, the more times we can ask for prayers and wishes from all those people. I will ask you the same, try and pray for us so that as Zimbabwe we all qualify and make our way to the World Cup next year in England,\" he said. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> In a sport where mere fractions and inches matter, every professional athlete won't be able to crack the code and fulfil dreams. But, an athlete can guarantee that he will work hard and toil in order to reach the summit. When Raza bats, bowls or fields, it feels as if he has signed an unwritten contract with Zimbabwe cricket and its fans that he will give his 100 per cent every time. </p> </section>  <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Rudyard Kipling, the famous writer-cum poet, had once said: \"If you can meet with triumph and disaster, And treat those two impostors just the same.\" If we trace Raza's career so far, including his early life experiences, he seems to have followed the path that Kipling had written about - treating triumphs and failures the same. </p> </section>  <div class=\"cb-news-copyright\"> &copy; <span itemprop=\"publisher\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Cricbuzz</span></span> </div> <section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\"> <table class='cb-social'><tr><td class=\"cb-social-td\"><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share on Facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/100707/destinys-child-raza-treats-triumphs-and-failures-the-same&text=Destiny's child, Raza treats triumphs and failures the same\"\tclass=\"cb-social-ancr cb-social-ancr-fb\"><span class=\"cb-ico cb-fb-share \"></span><span class=\"cb-font-12\">Share</span></a></td><td class=\"cb-social-td\"><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/100707/destinys-child-raza-treats-triumphs-and-failures-the-same&text=Destiny's child, Raza treats triumphs and failures the same&via=cricbuzz\" class=\"cb-social-ancr cb-social-ancr-twt\"><span class=\"cb-ico cb-twt-share\"></span><span class=\"cb-font-12\">Tweet</span></a></td></tr></table> </section> <div class=\"cb-col cb-col-100\" style=\"margin-bottom:20px; padding: 0px 5px!important;\"> <div class=\"text-black cb-font-18 text-bold\" style=\"margin-bottom:5px;\">TAGS</div> <div class=\"cb-col cb-col-100\"> <code class=\"label-tags cb-tags-dark text-white cb-font-12\"> <a class=\"text-white\" href=\"/cricket-team/zimbabwe/12\" title=\"Zimbabwe\"> Zimbabwe </a> </code> <code class=\"label-tags cb-tags-dark text-white cb-font-12\"> <a class=\"text-white\" href=\"/profiles/9354/sikandar-raza\" title=\"Sikandar Raza\"> Sikandar Raza </a> </code> </div> </div> <div class=\"cb-col-100 cb-col cb-ad-unit\" ng-cloak ng-if='!$root.$GEO.isGeo(\"EU\")'><div id=\"native_related_news\" class=\"cb-col-100 cb-col ad-native ng-cloak\" ad-loaded=\"false\"></div></div> </article> <div class=\"cb-col-100 cb-col\"> <h3>COMMENTS</h3> <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/100707/destinys-child-raza-treats-triumphs-and-failures-the-same\" data-width=\"600\" data-numposts=\"10\" data-colorscheme=\"light\"></div></div><script>CBQueue.push(function(){\t(function(d, s, id) {\tvar js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\tif (d.getElementById(id)) return;\tjs = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\tjs.async = true;\tjs.defer = true;\tjs.src = \"https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v6.0&appId=30119633160\";\tfjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\t}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n",

After hours of planning, hours of training and hard work, and repetition, we may fall short of the desired outcome or an unforeseen event could lead us to an unknown path. That is when we usually take solace in the word 'fate' and say, \"It was not meant to be. Everything happens for a reason\". </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe's middle-order batsman, <a href=\"/profiles/9354/sikandar-raza\">Sikandar Raza</a>, also could have blamed fate and asked himself, \"why me\" or \"what if\" after his grand plan to become a fighter Pilot in the PAF (Pakistan Air Force) was cut off abruptly. Raza was a faithful student to his dreams, tirelessly chasing them down in his own workshops. For a while, Raza's faith in his hard work seemed to have reaped rewards, as he passed the exam to enter the Pakistan Air Force School in Lower Topa. Incidentally, he was one of just 60 students who made the cut from thousands of aspirants. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Unfortunately, after training meticulously for three and a half years at the college, the final medical report indicated that there was 'lens opacity' - a blind spot in his eye. The blind spot affects a person when he is at an altitude. For a while, the chariot of his dreams was broken. Years of dedication and hardship for no reward it seemed. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> However, he did not lose hope. In 2002, Raza's parents (from Sialkot in Pakistan) moved to Zimbabwe. He pursued B.Sc in computer science at the Glasgow Caledonian University, Scotland, and that is when he started to play semi-professional cricket. He returned to Zimbabwe where he performed well in domestic cricket and has never looked back since. In a way, Raza is akin to a confident sea explorer who found the route to the shore when his crew members had lost hope. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Something people might not know, not a lot of people know is going to Air Force College was my decision,\" Raza said to Cricbuzz. \"I was fascinated by that, by the fighter planes and wanted to be a fighter pilot. Nobody grooved that in my mind. It was just my idea, at a very young age I wanted to be a fighter pilot. My family supported me through and through. That is something many people do not know. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Look, I always wanted to study. I always wanted to graduate with a degree. My family wanted the same as well. So while studying, I was also playing cricket. The switching wasn't too bad. It wasn't too difficult because cricket is something I really enjoyed, I loved the game. And I was playing in Scotland as a semi-professional. I spoke to my family, I spoke to my dad that I would like to take a year out of my studies and try my hand in cricket. I had good results in that year. So I went back and finished my degree and came back and started (cricket). Not started...I was trying to get picked by one of the franchises. I was luckily in a position at the right time, and I got picked and after that it has been a very blessed ride,\" he observed. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Now, Raza is undoubtedly one of the premier batsmen in the Zimbabwe set-up. He has notched up more than 2,000 ODI runs at 34.14 in the 50-over version, and has a creditable average of 38.1 in the traditional format. More importantly, he seems to be a capable finisher of the task in hand. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Some athletes are haunted by pressure and a few others lift themselves. Raza comes across as one of those cricketers who isn't simply satisfied by taking his side to the cusp of victory, he wants to take the team all the way. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza plays with a free mind, staying in the present. The point can be capsulised by his gritty, unbeaten 27 against Sri Lanka in Hambantota last year. The visitors, who were well-placed at 137 for 1, suddenly slid to 175 for 7, while chasing 204. But, Raza hung in there and when six runs were required, lofted Wanidu Hasaranga into the stands. Runs came in trickles but Raza didn't give it away, and instead chiselled Zimbabwe's first-ever series win in Sri Lanka. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Over his brief international career, Raza has made strong statements when it counted. He posted his first ODI hundred when the African country was hunting down a total of over 250 against Afghanistan in 2014. The very next year, when Zimbabwe were hurtling towards an embarrassing loss versus New Zealand (the tourists were 146 for 8 batting first), Raza stitched a stand of 89 for the ninth wicket with Tinashe Panyangara and piloted his side to a respectable 235 for 9. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> When Zimbabwe embarked on a trip to his land of birth, Pakistan, in 2015, he shone brightly with a superlative century in the Lahore ODI. His only Test hundred, which he composed in Sri Lanka last year, didn't just help Zimbabwe recover from a precarious 59 for 5 in the second essay, but also post a sizeable 388. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza noted that he tries to envisage different scenarios at nets to get himself mentally prepared and on occasions, waits for his 'gut feel' to guide him and say what is right. \"I think the best answer I can give you is to try and picture yourself before the game that this could happen to you. When you train, try and train in an atmosphere where you picture a lot of scenarios and you train for those scenarios. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"So when the scenario actually happens, you know you're mentally prepared. Our body is going through a lot of pain and a lot of training anyway, so physically you're always there. It is the mental side sometimes that gives in or doesn't accept an idea. In the nets, I'm not shy to try new things, try different methods, try and come up with my plans. And sometimes during a game, I go with an opposite plan - just what my gut feeling says to me. So, I just try and remain calm. I am a huge believer of just (giving) your best and what will be, will be,\" he added. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza's infectious energy on the field is also an indicator that he can become a fine leader. He has already showcased his leadership credentials by captaining his adopted country to a thrilling 10-run win over India in a T20I played in Harare in 2015. Just a day before the match, Prosper Utseya, the veteran cricketer, had levelled racism allegations against the then Zimbabwe Cricket Chairman Alistair Campbell. The African country had also slipped to 13 straight defeats in international cricket. So when Raza took over the leadership duties from an injured Elton Chigumbura, he had an uphill task but he passed the test with flying colours. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Captaining the side was a very blessed experience and what I remember was I was told 30 minutes before the toss I will be captaining because Elton [Chigumbura] was not fit. We waited for his result of his fitness test, and only 30 minutes before I was told that I was captaining today's game, so it was all very quick like it was a T20 game. So the game is pretty quick as well. So it was a very good and blessed experience,\" Raza said. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe will certainly bank on the in-form Raza to make an impact in the upcoming World Cup Qualifiers at home. With ICC deciding to shorten the number of teams in the 50-over World Cup to just 10 and eight countries having already qualified, 10 teams will battle it out in the Qualifiers for the remaining two spots. So there is a lot at stake for Zimbabwe's players. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> The World Cup Qualifies is also held at a time when Zimbabwe Cricket is still facing cash flow problems. Incidentally, ZC presently is in debt to numerous institutions - amounting to $19m. Cricketers have had to wade through delays in relation to match allowances. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe have also been paddling through troubled times since the start of this millennium. The African country has been hit by high unemployment rate, poverty and inflation. On November 15 last year, the army took control of Zimbabwe, with Robert Mugabe, the long-standing president, being ousted. Raza said that in the prevailing circumstances, a fine performance by the Zimbabwe cricket team on their home soil could bring some much needed cheer to a country wading through a tough phase. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"The honesty of the matter is this is one of the most important tournaments of our careers, a lot is hindering on it. In a way, it will define which way Zimbabwe cricket, in which way our careers go as well. 15 million people are hoping for a good result, and a time like this, in Zimbabwe all of us could use a little bit of happiness and a of bit good news as well. So there is a lot in this qualifiers for us. Hopefully, the more lives we touch, the more times we can ask for prayers and wishes from all those people.

            "[<p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Life - many times - has a curious way of laughing at us. After hours of planning, hours of training and hard work, and repetition, we may fall short of the desired outcome or an unforeseen event could lead us to an unknown path. That is when we usually take solace in the word 'fate' and say, \"It was not meant to be. Everything happens for a reason\". </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe's middle-order batsman, <a href=\"/profiles/9354/sikandar-raza\">Sikandar Raza</a>, also could have blamed fate and asked himself, \"why me\" or \"what if\" after his grand plan to become a fighter Pilot in the PAF (Pakistan Air Force) was cut off abruptly. Raza was a faithful student to his dreams, tirelessly chasing them down in his own workshops. For a while, Raza's faith in his hard work seemed to have reaped rewards, as he passed the exam to enter the Pakistan Air Force School in Lower Topa. Incidentally, he was one of just 60 students who made the cut from thousands of aspirants. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Unfortunately, after training meticulously for three and a half years at the college, the final medical report indicated that there was 'lens opacity' - a blind spot in his eye. The blind spot affects a person when he is at an altitude. For a while, the chariot of his dreams was broken. Years of dedication and hardship for no reward it seemed. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> However, he did not lose hope. In 2002, Raza's parents (from Sialkot in Pakistan) moved to Zimbabwe. He pursued B.Sc in computer science at the Glasgow Caledonian University, Scotland, and that is when he started to play semi-professional cricket. He returned to Zimbabwe where he performed well in domestic cricket and has never looked back since. In a way, Raza is akin to a confident sea explorer who found the route to the shore when his crew members had lost hope. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Something people might not know, not a lot of people know is going to Air Force College was my decision,\" Raza said to Cricbuzz. \"I was fascinated by that, by the fighter planes and wanted to be a fighter pilot. Nobody grooved that in my mind. It was just my idea, at a very young age I wanted to be a fighter pilot. My family supported me through and through. That is something many people do not know. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Look, I always wanted to study. I always wanted to graduate with a degree. My family wanted the same as well. So while studying, I was also playing cricket. The switching wasn't too bad. It wasn't too difficult because cricket is something I really enjoyed, I loved the game. And I was playing in Scotland as a semi-professional. I spoke to my family, I spoke to my dad that I would like to take a year out of my studies and try my hand in cricket. I had good results in that year. So I went back and finished my degree and came back and started (cricket). Not started...I was trying to get picked by one of the franchises. I was luckily in a position at the right time, and I got picked and after that it has been a very blessed ride,\" he observed. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Now, Raza is undoubtedly one of the premier batsmen in the Zimbabwe set-up. He has notched up more than 2,000 ODI runs at 34.14 in the 50-over version, and has a creditable average of 38.1 in the traditional format. More importantly, he seems to be a capable finisher of the task in hand. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Some athletes are haunted by pressure and a few others lift themselves. Raza comes across as one of those cricketers who isn't simply satisfied by taking his side to the cusp of victory, he wants to take the team all the way. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza plays with a free mind, staying in the present. The point can be capsulised by his gritty, unbeaten 27 against Sri Lanka in Hambantota last year. The visitors, who were well-placed at 137 for 1, suddenly slid to 175 for 7, while chasing 204. But, Raza hung in there and when six runs were required, lofted Wanidu Hasaranga into the stands. Runs came in trickles but Raza didn't give it away, and instead chiselled Zimbabwe's first-ever series win in Sri Lanka. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Over his brief international career, Raza has made strong statements when it counted. He posted his first ODI hundred when the African country was hunting down a total of over 250 against Afghanistan in 2014. The very next year, when Zimbabwe were hurtling towards an embarrassing loss versus New Zealand (the tourists were 146 for 8 batting first), Raza stitched a stand of 89 for the ninth wicket with Tinashe Panyangara and piloted his side to a respectable 235 for 9. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> When Zimbabwe embarked on a trip to his land of birth, Pakistan, in 2015, he shone brightly with a superlative century in the Lahore ODI. His only Test hundred, which he composed in Sri Lanka last year, didn't just help Zimbabwe recover from a precarious 59 for 5 in the second essay, but also post a sizeable 388. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza noted that he tries to envisage different scenarios at nets to get himself mentally prepared and on occasions, waits for his 'gut feel' to guide him and say what is right. \"I think the best answer I can give you is to try and picture yourself before the game that this could happen to you. When you train, try and train in an atmosphere where you picture a lot of scenarios and you train for those scenarios. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"So when the scenario actually happens, you know you're mentally prepared. Our body is going through a lot of pain and a lot of training anyway, so physically you're always there. It is the mental side sometimes that gives in or doesn't accept an idea. In the nets, I'm not shy to try new things, try different methods, try and come up with my plans. And sometimes during a game, I go with an opposite plan - just what my gut feeling says to me. So, I just try and remain calm. I am a huge believer of just (giving) your best and what will be, will be,\" he added. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Raza's infectious energy on the field is also an indicator that he can become a fine leader. He has already showcased his leadership credentials by captaining his adopted country to a thrilling 10-run win over India in a T20I played in Harare in 2015. Just a day before the match, Prosper Utseya, the veteran cricketer, had levelled racism allegations against the then Zimbabwe Cricket Chairman Alistair Campbell. The African country had also slipped to 13 straight defeats in international cricket. So when Raza took over the leadership duties from an injured Elton Chigumbura, he had an uphill task but he passed the test with flying colours. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"Captaining the side was a very blessed experience and what I remember was I was told 30 minutes before the toss I will be captaining because Elton [Chigumbura] was not fit. We waited for his result of his fitness test, and only 30 minutes before I was told that I was captaining today's game, so it was all very quick like it was a T20 game. So the game is pretty quick as well. So it was a very good and blessed experience,\" Raza said. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe will certainly bank on the in-form Raza to make an impact in the upcoming World Cup Qualifiers at home. With ICC deciding to shorten the number of teams in the 50-over World Cup to just 10 and eight countries having already qualified, 10 teams will battle it out in the Qualifiers for the remaining two spots. So there is a lot at stake for Zimbabwe's players. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> The World Cup Qualifies is also held at a time when Zimbabwe Cricket is still facing cash flow problems. Incidentally, ZC presently is in debt to numerous institutions - amounting to $19m. Cricketers have had to wade through delays in relation to match allowances. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> Zimbabwe have also been paddling through troubled times since the start of this millennium. The African country has been hit by high unemployment rate, poverty and inflation. On November 15 last year, the army took control of Zimbabwe, with Robert Mugabe, the long-standing president, being ousted. Raza said that in the prevailing circumstances, a fine performance by the Zimbabwe cricket team on their home soil could bring some much needed cheer to a country wading through a tough phase. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> \"The honesty of the matter is this is one of the most important tournaments of our careers, a lot is hindering on it. In a way, it will define which way Zimbabwe cricket, in which way our careers go as well. 15 million people are hoping for a good result, and a time like this, in Zimbabwe all of us could use a little bit of happiness and a of bit good news as well. So there is a lot in this qualifiers for us. Hopefully, the more lives we touch, the more times we can ask for prayers and wishes from all those people. I will ask you the same, try and pray for us so that as Zimbabwe we all qualify and make our way to the World Cup next year in England,\" he said. </p>, <p class=\"cb-nws-para\"> In a sport where mere fractions and inches matter, every professional athlete won't be able to crack the code and fulfil dreams. But, an athlete can guarantee that he will work hard and toil in order to reach the summit.
